## Community Guidelines

### Documentation Generation Ethics

Given the nature of this project, we have specific guidelines around documentation generation:

- **Respect intellectual property** - Only test documentation generation on projects you have permission to analyze
- **Protect sensitive information** - Don't include API keys, passwords, or proprietary algorithms in test projects
- **Accurate reporting** - Report documentation quality issues honestly and constructively
- **Quality contributions** - Ensure test projects and examples represent realistic use cases
- **Attribution** - Give credit to original code authors when sharing examples or test cases

### Technical Discussion Standards

- **Focus on technical merit** rather than personal preferences
- **Provide constructive criticism** with specific suggestions for improvement
- **Share knowledge freely** about prompt engineering and agent optimization
- **Document your testing** when reporting bugs or suggesting enhancements
- **Respect different approaches** to documentation generation and agent design

### Learning and Growth

- **Welcome newcomers** to multi-agent systems and Claude Code CLI
- **Share learning resources** about documentation best practices
- **Encourage experimentation** with different agent configurations
- **Support debugging efforts** when documentation generation doesn't work as expected
- **Celebrate successful implementations** and quality documentation outputs

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

This includes:

- **GitHub repository** interactions (issues, pull requests, discussions)
- **Documentation generation** testing and feedback
- **Community forums** and chat platforms
- **Conference presentations** or talks about the project
- **Blog posts** or articles referencing the project
- **Social media** posts about project experiences

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.

## Reporting

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at [INSERT CONTACT EMAIL]. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

### What to Include in Reports

When reporting issues, please include:

- **Description of the incident** with as much detail as possible
- **Date and time** when the incident occurred
- **Platform or location** where it happened (GitHub, Discord, etc.)
