## [1.0.1] - 2025-08-20

### Changed
- **PlantUML Diagrammer Agent Enhancement**: Major update to readability-first approach
  - Replaced hardcoded element limits with browser-based quality validation
  - Added Playwright integration for real-world diagram testing in 800px viewports
  - Implemented visual balance requirements with canvas utilization metrics
  - Dynamic element count based on readability outcomes (14 readable elements > 5 confusing elements)
  - Added comprehensive quality validation protocol with iterative improvement
  - Enhanced layout optimization with quadrant distribution analysis
  - Context-aware design for documentation embedding rather than full-screen viewing

### Technical Improvements
- **Browser-Based Validation**: Playwright testing replaces SVG-only analysis
- **Dynamic Quality Metrics**: Readability measured in actual browser context
- **Visual Balance Analysis**: Automated detection of layout issues and empty space problems
- **Iterative Refinement Process**: Continuous improvement based on validation feedback
- **Professional Quality Standards**: Measurable criteria for diagram approval

### Impact
- Diagrams now optimized for real documentation usage scenarios
- Significant improvement in diagram readability when embedded in markdown/docs
- Better visual balance with no large empty corners or cramped layouts
- Quality-driven approach replaces arbitrary technical constraints
